### Project Description
This project aims to classify news articles as "Real" or "Fake" using Deep Learning. We implemented two models:
1. **Bi-Directional LSTM** (Baseline)
2. **BERT** (Transfer Learning)
3. **Ensemble Model** (Weighted Average of LSTM + BERT)

**Final Accuracy:** 99.93%

### Dataset
We used the **Fake and Real News Dataset** from Kaggle.
To run this code, please download `True.csv` and `Fake.csv` from the link below and place them in the runtime directory.
